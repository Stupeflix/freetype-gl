HOW TO GENERATE DISTMAP
=======================

The first thing to do is to add your font into the fonts/ folder:

$ cp myFont.ttf fonts/

To generate a distmap for your font, just use run.sh to build everting and generate the font:

./run.sh OUTFILES INFILE [RESOLUTION]

- OUTFILES - The out files names (with league, league.json and league.png will be created in build folder).
- INFILE - The input ttf font file.
- RESOLUTUION - Atlas are generated with size which are powers of two, so you can ajust glyph resolutions to fill all the picture.

Example:
-------

$ ./run.sh league fonts/league.ttf 80

$ cp build/league.{png,json} ~/Desktop
